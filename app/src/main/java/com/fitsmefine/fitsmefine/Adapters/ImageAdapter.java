/**
 * Created by Dane on 5/11/2017.
 ************************** Display the images in a grid view ********************************
 * This implements some required methods inherited from BaseAdapter. The constructor and getCount() are self-explanatory. Normally, getItem(int) should return the actual object at the specified position in the adapter, but it's ignored for this example. Likewise, getItemId(int) should return the row id of the item, but it's not needed here.
 * The first method necessary is getView(). This method creates a new View for each image added to the ImageAdapter. When this is called, a View is passed in, which is normally a recycled object (at least after this has been called once), so there's a check to see if the object is null. If it is null, an ImageView is instantiated and configured with desired properties for the image presentation:
 * setLayoutParams(ViewGroup.LayoutParams) sets the height and width for the Viewâ€”this ensures that, no matter the size of the drawable, each image is resized and cropped to fit in these dimensions, as appropriate.
 * setScaleType(ImageView.ScaleType) declares that images should be cropped toward the center (if necessary).
 * setPadding(int, int, int, int) defines the padding for all sides. (Note that, if the images have different aspect-ratios, then less padding will cause more cropping of the image if it does not match the dimensions given to the ImageView.)
 * If the View passed to getView() is not null, then the local ImageView is initialized with the recycled View object.
 * At the end of the getView() method, the position integer passed into the method is used to select an image from the mThumbIds array, which is set as the image resource for the ImageView.
 * All that's left is to define the mThumbIds array of drawable resources.
